<p id="text"> Recently in Vulture, art critic Jerry Saltz opened a hard headedly titled guide "How to be an artist: 33 rules to take you from clueless amateur to generational talent (or at least help you live life a little more creatively)" by writing, "Art is for anyone. It is just not for everyone." I wo not say anything about art (not now, at least), but I do believe, however naively, that reading is for anyone and everyone. "High" and "low" are racist and classist terms I tend to try to forget about it. Black queer culture has taught us that it is not only texts that get read, it is you and me, and your mama.
<br>
In 2018, I read little for pleasure. I read for work. I worked at home. I worked in different countries, different beds. The less I read, the less together I was emotionally and thus creatively. My relationship to working, and the conditions that I work and read through, are both what sustain me and condemn me. After a breakup, I dated more than ever this year, which was still not much, but with these new people who had been in my life barely a minute, I would give them everything: time, dreams, dinners, desire. After all, everything is not much when you feel like you have nothing. I could not stop comparing their exterior with my interior. The terror would stop, however momentarily, when I devoured the insides of a text.
